#basic-hon-client

A simple hon client I used for testing which demonstrates the usage of [HoNCore](http://github.com/Joev-/HoNCore)

It runs on the command line and requires that HoNCore be available in the lib module (Create a lib folder with an __init__.py file and symlink/copy honcore to there)
